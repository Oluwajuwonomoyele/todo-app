## Overview
This is a project i love  very much because it is the first project i worked on as my main javascript project. It took me a while, but i'm really happy i went through each stage whilst using all i've learnt about javascript. It took me about 2 weeks to complete this project.

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size

- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
